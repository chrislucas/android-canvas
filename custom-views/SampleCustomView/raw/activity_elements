Exported
android:exported
This element sets whether the activity can be launched by components of other applications:
If "true", the activity is accessible to any app, and is launchable by its exact class name.

If "false", the activity can be launched only by components of the same application, applications
with the same user ID, or privileged system components. This is the default value when there are no
intent filters.

If an activity in your app includes intent filters, set this element to "true" to allow other
apps to start it. For example, if the activity is the main activity of the app and includes the
category "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER".

If this element is set to "false" and an app tries to start the activity, the system throws an
ctivityNotFoundException.

This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other applications.
Permissions can also be used to limit the external entities that can invoke the activity
(see the permission attribute).
